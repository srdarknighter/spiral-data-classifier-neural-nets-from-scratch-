Generated a random set of spiral data of 100 points grouped into 3 classes and classified it with a near ~95% accuracy

1. Used ReLu Activation and Softmax Activation in the hidden layers to get non-linearity in the data and to obtain the outputs as normalised probabilty distributions respectively 
2. Implemented it completely from scratch using backpropogation and updationg, without using libraries like tenserflow/keras or pytorch
3. Used ADAM optimiser that uses the concept of momentum and adaptive learning rates which gave the best results
